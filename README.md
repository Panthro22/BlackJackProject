# BlackJackProject


## Description:
This applications is to allow a user to play a game of Blackjack. This uses a generic 52 card deck without Jokers. The base classes can be used to play many other card games. This allows for the code to be reusable for later use.



## Technologies:

- OOP is used in this application to achieve data abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation.
- Using unicode to implement low level graphics.
- types of classes used in this Project are:
1. Concrete class
2. Abstract class
3. Enum class
- Used while loops to continue the game as much as the player wanted.
- Arraylist to hold cards into a deck and hands as needed.
- If else statements to have evaluation of the game to determine next step based on game logic.

## What I Learned
I have learned that there are more often times of refractor to simplify coding to do the same thing and become more readable. That converting a customer expectations from english to program, has its difficulties all in its own. Getting additional clarification on how the customer would rather have it. At least how the outcome is presented to the customer/user.

> That code is more often read than written.   

### Tasks
- [x] Create enum of Rank and Suit
- [x] Create card class to store Rank and Suit information.
- [x] Deck class to store the cards needed to make a basic deck.
- [x] Abstract class for a hand.
- [x] BlackjackHand class
- [x] BlackjackGame class to handle game logic
- [ ] "Soft" Ace - Ace has the value 1 or 11.
- [ ] Allow multiple players in the game.
- [ ] Implement a monetary system so players can place bets on their hands.
- [ ] Allow players to split hands.
- [ ] Allow players to double down.
- [ ] Deal from a multi-deck shoe.
- [ ] implementing in-game suggestions based on the player's current hand? Maybe a card-counting player?
